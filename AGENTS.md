This is a monorepo for the riichi-app project. The riichi-app is a collection of tools to track and aid with live Riichi Mahjong game sessions.

Currently the monorepo includes the following packages:

- `model`, an Python and uv package for training the model
- `api`, an Python and uv package for being the web JSON api for a frontend package to come

For whatever package you are working with, use the respective AGENTS.md file located in each package root.
